# ror-metarepo
This is a repository which allows you to dump all your git repos from multi hosts in a DB. Nobody seems to have domne it before so here you are. Provide CLI to import it.

## Where does it run

I want to dockerize and run it on GCP resources.

* GAE Flex (first)
* GKE
* cloud run then.
